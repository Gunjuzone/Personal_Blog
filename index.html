	<h2>On Purpose & The Futilily of Legacy</h2>

<p class="quote"> 
	 </p>

 
<p>
	I am eight, or nine; I am not certain. It is around that time in my life when I desire to be older, 
	dissatisfied with how small I am and can’t stop adding “plus” to my age when asked. 
	I am in that phase where I have just discovered the wonderful realities of D.O Fagunwa and J.O Odunjo, 
	and now I can’t stop searching for more in every sentence I see. 
	I am the kid who spends events in quiet corners, lost in thought, only to answer when I am called that I am thinking. 
	In the quiet of my head, I would ponder about life, and little injustices to me: like not being able to lick as much Milo 
	as I wanted or eat my rice with fish. 	If these things were going to finish anyway, why couldn’t I have them? 
	I am struggling with words that seem too long for my eyes to catch, and for me to understand, but I am reading anyway. 
	It is during this period that I stumbled upon <i>The Purpose Driven Life</i>, its pristine burgundy cover promising answers to questions I didn’t know how to ask. 
	It wasn’t the answer. The words seemed foreign, heavy with meanings I wasn’t ready to grasp. 
	I abandoned it and returned to my Yoruba mythology encyclopedia, trading existential questions for tales of gods and heroes. . </p>
<p>
	Years later, the questions remain unanswered. It seems like nothing is working, and when things finally do by chance, 
	I am tired from achieving it and can’t find the reason why I bothered in the first place. 
	My uncle prays that I’ll create something that makes me unforgettable, a legacy to outlast my time. 
	It’s a prayer full of love but also heavy with pressure. A legacy, who does it really serve? 
	If I succeed and leave my mark, would I even know it in death? And if I achieve greatness in life, 
	what then? Once you reach the summit, where do you go? Of what purpose is waking up, and going again, 
	and again, when it seems like there is always more to be done. There is no end to it till your last day. 
	And all that is left is the finality of the end, when your world, the world as you know it, 
	ceases to exist and even if you lived a purposeful life, it would not matter then...  </p>

<p>
	Byung-Chul Han writes in The Burnout Society that the modern world has transformed individuals into self-exploiter, 
	mere producers and consumers of their own existence. That we are constantly striving for achievements that leave us physically and mentally drained. 
	For Mr Han, the endless chase for optimization and productivity alienates us from true fulfillment. 
	That is, the legacy we chase often becomes just another metric in the neoliberal order, a mark of success rather than a source of meaning. 
	My uncle’s prayer, though well-intentioned, reflects this societal obsession with legacy as a marker of worth, 
	reducing life to a quantifiable accomplishment. Thinking about it again, the expectation to achieve greatness, to leave a legacy, 
	feels less like a noble goal and more like a trap. 
	This externally imposed cycle of productivity and exploitation is draining, and it has left me perpetually dissatisfied.</p>
<p>
	When I think about the legacies left by my great-grandfather and my grandfather, I realize that neither of them set out to create one. 
	It happened because of the way they lived their lives. Perhaps true legacies are accidental? 
	Especially since every intentional effort to replicate their legacies has failed, utterly. 
	Why, then, am I being burdened with this expectation of greatness? I started the year with the news of death, a double tragedy. 
	First, the videographer who captured my wedding so beautifully, and then my distant cousin, who was once the envy of our little town. 
	My cousin, the first to sell mobile phones and SIM cards in our area, a symbol of success in the early 2000s. 
	The videographer, though I knew little about him personally, his art brought joy and beauty into my life.
	Now they are both gone. What does their legacy matter now?  </p>

<p>
	Lately, I have  been thinking about people who have outlived their legacies, those who achieved greatness early and spend the rest of their lives unable to top it. 
	They spend their life chasing the good old days, they move to Turin, promised heaven and earth, failed to top their legacy, 
	left and in search of this same legacy they went to look for a greener pasture in a desert, how ironic. 
	What must it feel like to know your best work is behind you? I’m not sure, I don’t have the answers. 
	What I do know is that this pursuit of meaning, of waking up and trying again and again, feels both necessary and futile. 
	Necessary because it’s what keeps us moving forward, futile because there’s no finish line, no final moment of “completion.” </p>

<p>
	While Mr Han paints a picture of the pressures we face in this constant pursuit of self-optimization, 
	there is a little to non-existent offer  of guidance on how to resist or transcend these pressures. 
	Is abandoning the pursuit of legacy the solution, or is there value in striving despite its futility? 
	Again, more questions than answers; and it is this uncertainty that continues to haunt me. 
	Maybe the purpose isn’t in creating something that outlasts us but in striving. 
	Maybe it's about the connections we make, the relationships we nurture, 
	the love we offer and the kindness we extend to the people around us. 
	In this, I find solace. </p>
