	<h2>ON RESPONSIBILITIES & BLACK TAX</h2>

<p class="quote"> 
	Dear Friends, </p>

 
<p>
	How often do we think about the weight we carry, the invisible threads that tether us to others, 
	weaving our lives into a tapestry of shared responsibilities? I’ve been sitting with this thought 
	lately, grappling with the reality of what it means to be the person others rely on, the one who 
	feels the pull of duty like an ever-present undercurrent, subtle but unrelenting. For some of us, 
	these responsibilities are heavier, more intricate, bound by culture, history, and an unspoken 
	understanding of what it means to succeed - not just for ourselves, but for everyone tied to us. 
	This is the essence of what many call black tax. </p>
<p>
	If you’re not familiar, black tax isn’t written down anywhere. It isn’t a contract you sign or an 
	agreement you formally enter. It’s more of a cultural inheritance - a rite of passage embedded in 
	love, duty, and survival. It’s the expectation - spoken or not - that as you climb, you pull others 
	up with you. It’s remitting part of your paycheck to the family back home, funding a sibling’s 
	education, or making sure that the lights stay on in a household you no longer live in. It’s love, 
	duty, pride, gratitude - and sometimes, a quiet resentment - all tangled up in a single package.  </p>

<p>
	Lately, I’ve been reflecting on the duality of this responsibility. On the one hand, it’s a privilege 
	to be in a position where you can give back, to honor the sacrifices that brought you to where 
	you are. It’s an act of love, a way of saying, “I see you, and I’m grateful for what you’ve done for 
	me.” But on the other hand, the weight can be suffocating. There’s an unspoken pressure to keep 
	going, to succeed at all costs, because failure doesn’t just affect you - it ripples outward, touching 
	everyone who depends on you. And on those days, I find myself asking: Whose dreams am I 
	chasing? Are they mine, or are they shaped by the expectations of others? </p>
<p>
	It’s a hard question to sit with. There’s guilt in even asking it. How can I feel overwhelmed when 
	I’ve been given opportunities others only dream of? How can I resent what is, at its heart, an act 
	of love?</p>
<p>
	But I am learning that it’s okay to feel conflicted. It’s okay to carry this weight and still feel the 
strain. It’s okay to want to give back while also wanting to hold back. The key, I think, lies in 
balance - learning to honor our responsibilities without losing ourselves in them. It’s about setting 
boundaries, even when it feels selfish, and remembering that you can’t pour from an empty cup. 
It’s about acknowledging that while we owe much to our loved ones, we also owe something to 
ourselves. </p>

<p>
	So, Friend, if you’re carrying this weight too, I hope you’ll give yourself permission to breathe. To 
trust that you’re doing enough, even when it feels like you aren’t. To know that your worth isn’t 
tied to what you can provide for others. You’re allowed to rest, to dream, to pursue a life that 
fulfills you - not just the people around you. </p>

<p>
	Thank you for listening. I wish you clarity, strength, and the courage to honor both your 
responsibilities and your dreams. You’ve got this. </p>

<p> Shakur </p>
